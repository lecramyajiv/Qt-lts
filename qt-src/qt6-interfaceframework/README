The Qt Interface Framework module provides both the tools
and the core APIs, for you to implement Middleware APIs, Middleware
Back ends, and Middleware Services. The Qt Interface Framework
Generator provides a flexible way to define new APIs
via an Interface Definition Language (IDL) and
generate classes for use, from C++ and QML.
