GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't tested well
enough, or the code is not of good enough quality. They might be
close to being good quality, but they're missing something - be it a
code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a real live
maintainer, or some actual wide use.


optional dependencies: avtp, libmicrodns, libnice, tinyalsa
