# Qt-lts

This repo contains SlackBuild Script for Qt LTS

It contains three folders qt-src,qt-bin and attic

qt-src builds invidual qt modules from source except
for qt-webengine and qt-webview.

qt-bin downloads and builds invidual
qt modules binary published by Qt. This does not
contain qt-doc module so documentation isn't
available.

The attic folder contains broken and non working
slackbuilds I may revisit them in the future.
It contains two slackbuilds qtwebengine in qt-src and
qtcreator in qt-bin.
