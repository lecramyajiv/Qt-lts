# Qt-lts

This repo contains SlackBuild Script for Qt LTS

It contains three folders qt-src,qt-bin and attic

qt-src builds invidual qt modules from source except
for qt-webengine and qt-webview.

qt-bin downloads and builds invidual
qt modules binary published by Qt. This does not
contain qt-doc module so documentation isn't
available. This is an unofficial binary
installation. It downloads the binaries from the
official qt website and installs them.
you can view them [here](https://download.qt.io/online/qtsdkrepository/linux_x64/desktop/qt6_681/qt6_681/)

You can download the official Qt installer from the
Qt.io website.You need a Qt account in order to use the installer.

The attic folder contains broken and non working
slackbuilds I may revisit them in the future.
It contains two slackbuilds qtwebengine in qt-src and
qtcreator in qt-bin.
